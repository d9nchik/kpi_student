## Requirements

To start an adventure you need a modern browser with **JavaScript support** and nothing more.

## Dependencies

### We depend on

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) -> typization for pure JS

### Development dependencies

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) -> _testing_ library
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) -> formater tool
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) -> reduce common bugs with linter
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) -> library for git hooks
- [pretty-quick](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pretty-quick) -> for formating stage zone
- [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/) -> template for creating react application

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn run test:watch`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the CI test mode. See section [on your own environment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/#linux-macos-bash)

### `yarn run test:watch`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run test:coverage`

Launches the test runner with coverage in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests with coverage](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/#coverage-reporting) for more information.

### `yarn run format`

Launches [prettier](https://prettier.io/) on every file and write to drive.

### `yarn run format:stage`

Launches [pretty-quick](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pretty-quick) on stage files.

### `yarn run check-format`

Launches [prettier](https://prettier.io/) on every file and check whether they properly formatted if not exit with an error.

### `yarn run lint`

Runs [eslint](https://eslint.org/) against src directory

### `yarn run lint:write`

Runs [eslint](https://eslint.org/) against the src directory and tries to fix errors and warnings.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
